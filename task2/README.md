# Task 2 - dependencies

In this task, all dependencies in [pom.xml](pom.xml) have gone missing! It is your job to reintroduce them.

- Build with `mvn clean install`
- Based on error messages, figure out which dependencies contain the missing classes (google is your friend)
- Add missing dependencies
- You are done when `mvn clean install` builds successfully

You only need to change pom.xml.
