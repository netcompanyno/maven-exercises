# Task 3 - dependency scopes

In this task, you can only change the `scope` of the dependencies in [pom.xml](pom.xml).

- First, make sure `mvn clean install` builds successfully
- Next, run [Hello.java](src/main/java/com/netcompany/maven/task3/Hello.java) without errors (use your IDE)

Note:
- Fix one dependency at the time and run again
- For the sake of the exercise, all dependencies should have an explicit scope, even if it is the default scope.
